* Yandexâ€™s weather dataset - [LINK](https://research.yandex.com/shifts/weather)
* Datasaurus dataset - [LINK](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/datasauRus/vignettes/Datasaurus.html)

## Python packages

The code snippets used in the blog post use the following packages:

* `nannyml == 0.8.1`
* `pandas == 1.3.5`
